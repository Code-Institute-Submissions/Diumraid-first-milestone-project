# First Milestone Project
This project was completed to showcase my own abilities with HTML and CSS and to also showcase projects that have been completed to date and also that can be added for the future.
It is my own personal website where anyone can view and review previous projects and can also get intouch if they would like to hear more.
## UX
This website was build for Recruiters and Talent Acquisition professionals looking for potential hires where they can have a good overview of myself my experience, education, skills and hobbies. 
It also provides them with the opportunity to view projects that I have completed.

* As a recruiter or TA if they were to come across my websites and they are looking for my experience to date thay can do so by viewing the landing page and clicking on the different positions and get a full breakdown of my responsibilities
* As a recruiter or TA if they wanted to see what projects I have completed they can do sop easily by selecting the portfolio section of my website where they can click on each project and it will take them to that specific project.
* If a recruiter was looking to get in touch they have the option to use the form available or also to click on the link to LinkedIn and reach out if that way is preferred.
